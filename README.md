# 🍽️ Recipe Recommender System with Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

This project builds a **Recipe Recommender System** using a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** architecture to learn latent taste representations from user–recipe interactions.  
It leverages **PyTorch**, **Numpy**, and **Pandas**, and uses a large-scale dataset of user reviews to provide personalized recipe recommendations.

## 🧠 Overview

The model learns user and recipe embeddings through a **VAE** trained on rating data, capturing the underlying taste preferences of users.  
It then predicts missing ratings to generate personalized recipe recommendations.

**Dataset summary:**
Data was downloaded from Kaggle and originally is from food.com. The recipes dataset contains 522,517 recipes from 312 different categories. This dataset provides information about each recipe like cooking times, servings, ingredients, nutrition, instructions, and more.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Filtered active users and frequently rated recipes  
   - Transformed review data into a user–recipe interaction matrix  
   - Split data into training, validation, and test sets  

2. **Model Architecture**  
   - Encoder compresses high-dimensional user–recipe interactions into a low-dimensional latent space  
   - Decoder reconstructs the user’s interaction vector  
   - Loss combines reconstruction error (MSE) and KL divergence  

3. **Training**  
   - Optimized using Adam  
   - KL-divergence weighting (`α`) set to 0.01  
   - Early stopping based on validation loss  

4. **Evaluation & Recommendations**  
   - Reconstructed rating matrix used to predict unseen recipes  
   - Evaluated using RMSE and recall metrics
